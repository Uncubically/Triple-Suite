C++ Syntax

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    int main() {
        cout << "Statement";
        return 0;
    };


Source Code Explanation:
    Line 1: #include <iostream> is a header file library to work with input and output objects such as cout.
    Line 2: using namespace std; means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.
    Line 3: A blank line. C++ ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.
    Line 4: Another thing that always appear in a C++ program, is int main\(\). This is called a function.
            Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
    Line 5: cout \(pronounced \"see-out\"\) is an object used together with the insertion operator \(\<\<\) to output/print text.
    Line 6: return 0; ends the main function.

C++ supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
    Less than: a < b
    Less than or equal to: a <= b
    Greater than: a > b
    Greater than or equal to: a >= b
    Equal to a == b
    Not Equal to: a != b

You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.
Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.
